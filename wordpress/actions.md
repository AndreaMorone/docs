# Actions & Nodes
---
> **Action** represents each people's action in Messenger which send to FMB. You can response many times per action. For example, if people text: "hello", then you can response "hola!", then response "how can I help you today?". For each a group of `action - responses` we called **Node**.

## Types of Actions
Text
: When people text to FMB.

Click
: When people click on buttons which generated by FMB in Messenger.

Welcome
: When people start a first conversation and click "Get Started" button.

Default
: Fallback when user do one of above actions but have no response from FMB.

## Nodes
As mentioned above, **Node** is an action with a set of responses. So basically, Bot is constituted by Nodes. For example:

```
#!/ This is a Node

// People text is an action
People text: 'How old are you?'

// Bot answers are responses
Bot answers: 'Hmm, I think just 1 minute old!'
Bot answers: 'And you?'
```

## Response to People Actions
To response to people actions, we'll create Nodes, both [Bot Designer](bot-designer) and [FMB API](api) brings convenience way to do that. With Bot Designer, you can use point-and-click interface without coding knowledge, and with FMB API, you have full power to access dynamic data and do awesome stuff!
