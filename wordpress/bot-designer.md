## Start Using Bot Designer
To start using Bot Designer, go to Giga Messenger Bot under Settings menu in your *wp-admin*, and start define it in Bot Designer section.

## Response to People Actions
To response to each people action, we can create a node with related action. This part show you how to do it with Bot Designer.

- In `When` drop down, select an action.
    - If you select `Text`, you'll see a Content text box. Which allows you define what message content to response.
    - If you select `Click`, you'll see a dropdown which allows you select what button which people click to response.
    
- In `Response with` drop down, select a [message type](message-types) to response. Note that `Receipt` is not available for Bot Designer since it requires dynamic data.
