> **Event** represents each people's action in Messenger which send to Giga. You can response many times per people message. For example, if people text: "hello", then you can response "hola!", then response "how can I help you today?". For each a group of `event - responses` we called **Node**.

## Nodes
As mentioned above, **Node** is an event with a set of responses. So basically, Bot is constituted by Nodes. For example:

```
// This is a Node

// People text is an action
People text: 'How old are you?'

// Bot answers are responses
Bot answers: 'Hmm, I think just 1 minute old!'
Bot answers: 'And you?'
```
<a name="response"></a>
## Response People Actions
To response people actions, we'll create Nodes, both [Bot Designer](bot-designer) and [Giga API](api) brings a convenience way to do that.
